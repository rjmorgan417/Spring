        <p class="lead">Why choose us? We provide the bed and breakfast experience and resort level ammenities, for Motel 6 prices.</p>
        <p class="lead">Just a 5-minute walk away to the beach...
          Our local beach is pretty quiet with locals going for their daily walk or walking their dogs.
          Turn left out of our door and walk past the newly opened Nicoâ€™s
          Restaurant, cross a bridge and after the first street on your left,
          you will find a narrow pathway that has access to the beach.</p>
          <p>Note, if you are reading this, I typed the wrong message afternoon
          adding the picture, so now I am typing this to get Git to recognize a change
          so I can push again with something that it recognizes as a change.</p>
